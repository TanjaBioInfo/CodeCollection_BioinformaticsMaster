# ðŸ§¬ Code Collection from Bioinformatics Master's Degree

This repository contains a structured collection of Python and R projects developed during my Master's program in Bioinformatics. Some of the code was written independently, while others were created as part of university courses, practical exercises, and assignments.

The goal of this repository is to organize, document, and present these projects in a clear, thematic structure.
