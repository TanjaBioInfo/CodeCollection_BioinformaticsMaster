# ðŸ“Š R â€“ Statistical Projects and Exercises

This folder contains R scripts and RMarkdown documents focusing on statistical modeling, simulation, and data analysis. Most files originate from coursework and were partially extended during self-study.

## ðŸ“‚ Topics Covered

- ODE models for biological systems
- Epidemic modeling and simulation
- Resource competition in cancer dynamics
- Statistical analysis with `ggplot2` and `dplyr`

## ðŸ”Ž Examples

- `ODE-of-life-science.Rmd`
- `Cancer_Modelling.R`
- `Emerging_Epidemics.R`
- `Resource_Competition.R`

## ðŸ“Œ Note
These projects were created in the context of university exercises and illustrate key techniques in dynamic modeling, differential equations, and biological interpretation using R.
